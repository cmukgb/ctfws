%% Welcome to the true form of the Capture the Flag with Stuff Rules.
%% This is the base file from which the Html and TeX versions are generated.
%%
%% The format is largely inspired by wiki syntax, and fairly simple.
%% Hopefully it's obvious from usage, but the following is a complete
%% description to avoid confusion:
%%
%% ! name
%%    Major section "name".
%% 
%% !!{image} name
%%    Subsection "name".  "image" is optional; if given, the file image.eps
%%    will be used as the tab image for this subsection.
%%
%% * Rule ...
%%    A rule.  May stretch across multiple lines; ends at the next
%%    (sub)section or (sub)rule.
%%
%% ** Subrule ...
%%    A subrule; identical to a rule except for numbering purposes.
%%
%% [label] 
%%    After !, !!, *, or **, indicates the label of the section or rule for
%%    references.
%%
%% [[label]]
%%    Indicates a reference to a labeled rule; will be substituted with the
%%    number of the section or rule associated with the label.  (Including
%%    only the levels necessary; e.g., a labeled subsection might show up as
%%    I.C, while a labeled subrule might show up as I.C.5.b)
%%
%% %Comment
%%    A comment until end of line.  Useful for documentation.
%%
%% \section = n
%% \subsection = n
%%    Set the current (sub)section counter.  Note that it is incremented
%%    before use (eh... it's how LaTeX does it), so setting it to -1 means the
%%    next subsection is subsection 0 (which the generated TeX will output
%%    @).  Only used once, but might as well make it general...
%%
%% @ Rule
%%    This is a special hack for rule 0.  It makes it section 0, and the HTML
%%    is a bit bigger than a normal section.
%%
%% Also, note that the conversions are a bit hackish and do basically no error
%% checking, so mistakes will likely manifest as either broken formatting or
%% bizarre TeX errors.  However, the format should be simple enough to avoid
%% them.

!Base Rules

\subsection = -1
!!{meta} Meta
* When rules in this document conflict, the later rule takes
precedence.

** E.g. ([[may_not_capture]]) states that a captor may not capture, while
([[doc_ock_may_capture]])
states that a player wearing a Doc Ock's Belt may capture multiple times.

* The judges may choose to introduce extra stuff into
the game to keep it fresh and interesting.  Any such stuff must be clearly
explained during the rules presentation.

!!{teams_territories} Teams and Territories
* The game consists of two teams, red and yellow. Team
membership is indicated by colored armbands, which must be worn visibly
at all times.
* Each team has a home territory. One team's is Wean, the other's
is Doherty. The teams should swap territories after each game. The
territory is defined as the volume and all surfaces inside the building
with the doors closed, or as defined by the judges in the case of
ambiguity. Where there is a chamber between two sets of doors, the
chamber is included in the building.
* Certain areas such as labs, clusters, and any normally
inaccessible or otherwise restricted areas are forbidden. No player may
enter these areas at any time during the game.
* All areas which are neither a team's home territory nor
forbidden are neutral. There must always at least ten feet of neutral
territory between opposing teams' home territories.
* A player is considered to be in a team's territory if any
part of his body is in the team's territory. If a player is in neither
team's territory, he is in neutral territory. Magic items have no
effect on players in neutral territory.
** The inside of a door leading out of a team's territory is in
the team's territory, so can have a glyph applied to it. However, a
player touching this surface is next to the team's territory, not
within it, so is still in neutral territory.

!!{players} Players
* A player is any person playing the game.
* A teammate is a member of the same team.
* An enemy is a player who is not a teammate.
* A player may be normal, ethereal, captive, captor, prisoner, interrogation victim, or stunned.
* A normal player is in the default state described in these rules.
* An ethereal player may not use, drop, or pick up magic items,
is not affected by magic items, may not capture, and may not be
captured. A player may use jazz hands to signal ethereality.

* A captive is a player who has been captured (see [[capture]]).
Captives may not move or touch enemy flags and may not use magic items.
* A captor is a player who has captured another player (see
[[capture]]). Captors must lead their captives to the jail (see [[capture]]), but are
otherwise normal players.
* A prisoner is a player who was a captive, but has touched the Glyph of Jail
(see [[capture]]).
* An interrogation victim is a prisoner who has been given truth serum
by the jailer (see [[capture]]).  He may not use magic items, but otherwise acts
identically to a prisoner except where specified.
* A stunned player must sit on the floor until the stun wears
off. If he is captured while stunned, he becomes unstunned. A player may
not be stunned again while stunned.  Stunned players may not capture.
* Only normal players and captors can be stunned.

!!{capture}[capture] Capture and Imprisonment 
* If a player touches an enemy when both are in the first
player's home territory, he may choose to capture the enemy. At this
point, the enemy becomes a captive.
** As capture is optional, captors are encouraged to notify their
captives of this action ("Gotcha" is a good choice).
* A player, when captured, must immediately drop any flags he is carrying at the spot
where he was captured.
* A captive or prisoner must give up any non-concealable items upon
request of the captor or a teammate of the captor. Concealable items need not
be given up unless the enemy asking for them knows that the player has the
item.
*[may_not_capture] A captor must lead his captive directly to his team's Glyph
of Jail (see [[glyph_of_jail]]) at a reasonable speed. He cannot make any more
captures until his captive has entered jail by touching the Glyph of
Jail, either directly or through a chain of other prisoners. Once this
occurs, the captor is again a normal player, and the captive becomes a
prisoner.
* If a captor is stunned, his captive becomes a normal player.
* Prisoners may use magic items.

!![jail] Jail
* Each team has a jail, designated by the Glyph of Jail.
* One player on each team may take on the role of jailer by
wearing the team's Jailer Fedora. The jailer is a normal player except
as described in the remainder of this section. The jailer may at any
time transfer the fedora to a teammate, who becomes jailer, or
remove it, leaving no jailer.
** In particular, if the jailer is captured or stunned, the jail
remains functional; prisoners are not released.
* A player may not move the opposing team's fedora except to drop
it.
* The prisoners must form one or more chains, with each player
touching the Glyph of Jail either directly or through a chain of other
prisoners.
* If there is a jailer, he may relax the requirement to form chains.
** Typically, the jail is at the end of a hall, and prisoners are allowed to sit around in the vicinity of the jail.
*[jailbreak] Every fifteen minutes, starting from the beginning of play,
all prisoners are released from all jails. Released prisoners must
return to their home territories at reasonable speed, by the most
direct route. Prisoners released in this manner are ethereal until they
re-enter their home territories.
* A player in a normal state may touch a prisoner in another team's
jail. As long as freeing the prisoner does not break a chain leading back to
the jail, the prisoner is freed. Both players are ethereal and must return to
their home territories by the most direct route; they need not remain
together.
* The jailer has a supply of Truth Serum, which he may use by
poking a prisoner in the shoulder with a pinky finger. The prisoner
then becomes an interrogation victim.
* The jailer may then ask the victim up to six yes/no
questions, and the victim may lie no more than once. The victim may
answer "I don't know" if she really doesn't know, but then the question
doesn't count against the six.
* Upon completion of questioning, the victim is freed from jail
and must return to his home territory as after a jailbreak (see [[jailbreak]]).
Questioning is complete when the victim answers the sixth question, if
the jailer decides he is done with this victim, if the victim is
freed, at jailbreak, if there is no jailer, or if the jailer leaves line of
sight of the victim.
* There may be at most one truth serum victim in each jail.

!!{setup} Initial Setup and Game Completion
* At the beginning of the game, there is a setup period of
fifteen minutes. This time should be used for the placement of flags
and glyphs, and distribution of magic items. No player may enter enemy
territory during this period. Magic items have no effect during this
time.
* The game ends after one hour, or when there remains only one team with uncaptured flags.
* The winner is the team with the greatest number of points; in
the case of a tie, the winner is the tying team that reached its final
point total first.

!!{terms} Additional Terms
* Cooldown: This is a property of certain items. An item with
cooldown may not be used again for one minute after its use. This
requirement may be suspended by the singing of a number of verses from
a song determined before the game begins; the item is then usable after
singing that song.
* Concealment: Potions may be concealed, meaning they need not
be visible. All other game items must be visible at all times. A
captive is not required to give up a concealed item unless her captor
asks for it specifically and knows that she has the item.
* Dispelling: A dispelled item may not be used for its magical effects.
* Line of Sight: A player is within line of sight of an item or event
if he can rotate himself to bring it into his field of view.
* See: A player sees an item or event if it passes within his field of
view and he can recognize it.
* Sacrificial: Certain items are sacrificial. These items may
only be used in enemy territory, must be dropped upon use, and may not
be picked up or moved when in enemy territory.
* Key Words/Phrases: Some items have a key word or phrase used to
activate them.  This phrase must be said entirely in the territory where the
use occurs, and the action occurs upon completion of the phrase.

!!{flags} Flags
* Flags are large pieces of cloth or felt. Each team has three or more flags.
* Before each game, a point value will be assigned to each flag.
** Judges may or may not inform the players of these values on a per-game basis.
* Flags must be placed during the initial setup time, and their
placement must be supervised by a judge. They must be placed no higher
than six feet above the floor; at least half the flag must be visible
from every angle; flags must be placed no more than one flag per
hallway or corridor. If the flag is placed inside a container, there
must be an obvious way to remove the flag in one smooth motion.
* No flag may ever exist in an area with fewer than two exits,
unless it is being carried. If a flag is dropped in an area with only
one exit, a judge must move it the shortest possible distance to a
valid location.
* Any magic items a player is carrying are dispelled if he is
carrying a flag, and remain dispelled for one minute after the player
gives up the item or drops the flag.
* A player who brings a flag to the judges room earns for his
team the number of points associated with the flag. The flag is then
out of play for the remainder of the game.

!!{judges} Judges
* Judges are indicated by blue headbands, and are responsible for keeping the game running smoothly.
* The head judge is the final arbiter and scorekeeper, and should remain in the judges' room, Wean Hall 8427.
* An assistant head judge should reside at each team's jail.
* Each team should also have at least 3 roaming judges whose
responsibility is to resolve conflicts or perform other duties required
of them. Judges should attempt to resolve disputes fairly and find
outcomes agreeable to both sides. However, if this is impossible, the
judge's decision is final.


! Glyphs

!!{glyphs} General
* Glyphs are large sheets of paper or posterboard marked with a spell.
* Each glyph is owned by a particular team, indicated by the coloring of the glyph.
* A glyph must be taped to a wall or door in the team's territory.
* A glyph affects all players except those of its owning team.
* A glyph may not be placed within ten feet of a flag. If a
flag is dropped within ten feet of a dispellable glyph, the glyph is
dispelled for as long as the flag remains, and for one minute after.

!!{jail}[glyph_of_jail] Glyph of Jail
* The Glyph of Jail is indicated by the word "Jail".
* The Glyph of Jail defines the Jail, as described by section [[jail]].
* The Glyph of Jail cannot be dispelled.

!! Glyph of Entrancement 
* The Glyph of Entrancement is indicated by the word "Gotcha".
* A player who sees the Glyph of Entrancement is stunned for one minute.

!! Glyph of the Disgusting Doorknob 
* The Glyph of the Disgusting Doorknob is indicated by the word "Yukko".
* If a Glyph of the Disgusting Doorknob is on the side of a
door facing a player, she may not open the door or prevent it from
closing. If the Glyph is mounted on one of a set of doors, all doors
are affected.
* If a Glyph of the Disgusting Doorknob is mounted next to the
buttons controlling an elevator, no affected player may push any of the
buttons or prevent the elevator doors from closing.
* All parts of a team's territory must have at
least one path to neutral space which a player may travel without opening any
doors from a side affected by a Glyph of the Disgusting Doorknob.
** This prevents a player from being completely trapped by this
glyph.

!! Glyph of Alarm 
* The Glyph of Alarm is indicated by the word "Alarm".
* A player who sees the Glyph of Alarm must shout or sing
"Alarm" or a similar phrase as loudly as possible for one minute or
until she is captured or returns to neutral space.


! Potions

!!{potions} General
* Potions are foam-rubber balls.
* Potions are concealable.

!! Ninja Potion of Magic Smoke 
* The Ninja Potion of Magic Smoke is red and sacrificial.
* A captive may throw this potion onto the ground and yell as
loudly as possible "Poof, I am a Ninja!". All enemy players who hear this
and are within line of sight of the user are stunned for ten seconds.
** This includes enemy players within line of sight in all
territories. Players in neutral territory are unaffected, as they are
immune to all stuff.
** Yelling this phrase at other times is a violation of rule 0 - DON'T DO IT.

!! Potion of Wait... There's a Key at the Bottom of This
* The Potion of Wait... There's a Key at the Bottom of This is green and has cooldown.
* To use this potion, a player must bonk himself on the head
with this potion and use one of the key words "Lolt", "Jube", or "Key".
* A stunned player may use this potion to unstun himself and return to a normal state.
* A prisoner may use this potion to free himself from jail and return to a normal state.

!! Light Grenade
* The Light Grenade is blue.
* A player who picks up this potion in enemy territory is stunned for one minute.
** Picking up this potion in neutral or home territory has no effect.
* A player who voluntarily accepts this potion from another player is stunned for one minute.


! Wands

!!{wands} General
* Wands are two-foot lengths of foam rubber.
* A wand is used by whapping a person or glyph and shouting the keyword.
* Each use of the keyword invokes at most one wand on one subject.

!! Wand of Vengeance 
* The Wand of Vengeance has keyword "Toast", and is red and sacrificial.
* A player may whap an enemy in the enemy's home territory.
The user captures the enemy, and both players become ethereal.  The user
must lead the enemy back to his jail as directly as possible at reasonable
speed.
* Upon entry into the user's home territory, the user becomes a captor and the enemy becomes a captive.

!! Wand of Stun 
* The Wand of Stun has keyword "Stun", and is green and has cooldown.
* Any player whapped with this wand is stunned for one minute.

!! Wand of Dispel

all items carried by both players are dispelled for one minute.
* A glyph which is whapped by the Wand of Dispel is dispelled for one minute.


! Belts

!!{belts} General 
* A belt is a long sash of cloth or felt.
* To be active, a belt must be tied around a player's waist.
* A belt can be worn by at most one player.
* A player can wear at most one belt.

!! Andy Warhol's Belt of Pop Occultism 
* Andy Warhol's Belt of Pop Occultism is red and sacrificial.
* To activate this belt, the wearer must yell as loudly as
possible some phrase to be determined by the judges before the start of
the game. Upon activation, all enemy players within line of sight of
the user are stunned for one minute.
** Since the belt is sacrificial, the user must also drop the belt.

!! Goombah's Belt of Humiliating Protection 
* Goombah's Belt of Humiliating Protection is green.
* This belt is activated by skipping and loudly singing "Yankee
Doodle". While active, the wearer is immune to capture and stun.
* Any number of teammates may share the protection of this belt
by holding hands with the wearer, either directly or through a chain of
teammates, as long as all teammates in the chain are skipping and
singing along.
* If any player in the chain is dispelled, all items carried by all members of the chain are dispelled.
** In particular, the Goombah's belt is dispelled.
* This belt does not function in elevators.

!! Doc Ock's Belt of Many Arms 
* Doc Ock's Belt of Many Arms is blue.
*[doc_ock_may_capture] The wearer may have up to four captives, as long as he is within an
arm's length of each previous captive at the time of the next enemy's
capture.
** Once any captures have been made, he must still lead the
captives back to jail as usual, but may still capture on the
way to jail according to [[doc_ock_may_capture]].
* If the belt is dispelled, all captives except the first are freed. If
there is a tie, the captor may choose which one to keep.

! Sportsmanship 

!!{sportsmanship} Physicality 
* Players may not physically impede or block other players, either with their bodies or with objects.
** This includes actions like preventing elevators from
moving. Breakage of this rule is grounds to eject you from the game.
* You may not change official timekeeping watches.
* You may not fabricate or replicate game items.

!! Lies 
* Although lies and deceit are part of the game, there are several things you may not conceal, obfuscate, or lie about.
* You may not lie about whether you're in the game.
* You may not lie about which team you're on.
* You may not lie about the status of the game.
** For example, whether the game has started or ended.
* You may not lie about what non-concealable items you have.
* You may not lie about cooldown or dispel status of items.
* You may not lie about any player's status.
