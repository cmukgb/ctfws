The game is a competition between two teams, red and yellow, played in
Doherty
and Wean. One team is based in Doherty, and one in Wean. Each team has
a number of flags hidden throughout its territory, and the other team
tries to find these flags without being captured by the enemy
defenders. However, the task is made much more interesting by the
addition of stuff: wands, belts, and potions that affect the game in
exciting ways.
<h2> Base Rules </h2>Each player is on the yellow or the red team.
Team membership is indicated by appropriately colored bands, which
must be worn as armbands or headbands at all times.<br>
Each team has a home territory, either Wean or Doherty. All other
spaces (outside, Newell Simon, etc.) are neutral. Certain areas (labs,
clusters, any normally inaccessible or restricted areas) are forbidden
territory: no player may enter these at any time during the game.<br>
A player is in a team's territory if any part of their body is in the
team's territory. If he is in neither team's territory, he is in
neutral territory, and is not affected by Stuff. (The team territories
should be at least ten feet apart, so no player may be in both territories
simultaneously.)<br>
If you touch an enemy when both of you are in your home territory, you
may capture them. (Note that this is optional; make it clear whether or
not you are capturing). You may then request any non-concealable items
they are carrying, and they must give them to you. Further, if you know
that they have concealable items (e.g., you just saw them use one) you may
ask for those. If, however, you do not know that they have a concealable
item, they need not give it up.  They must also immediately
drop any flags they were carrying.<br>
You must then lead your captive directly to your team's jail at
reasonable speed. They may not use magic items (except for the Ninja
Potion) or move flags on their way to jail. You may not make any more
captures until they have entered the jail by touching the Glyph
of Jail (see below). At
this point, they may again use magic items). If you are stunned before
reaching jail, your prisoner is freed.<br>

<h3>Jail</h3>
The jail is designated by the Glyph of Jail (see Glyphs, below). There
is also an associated jailer's fedora; a player on the team owning the
jail wearing this fedora assumes the role of Jailer. This role is
transient; at any point, the jailer may give the fedora to a teammate
(who then becomes jailer) or remove it (leaving the team without a jailer).
Note that the lack of a jailer does not make the jail less functional;
prisoners are still stuck there. You may not move the opposing team's
fedora.<br>
The prisoners must form one or more chains, with each player touching
the Glyph of Jail either directly or through a chain of other
prisoners. The jailer (if one exists) may relax this requirement.
Typically, the jail is at the end of a corridor, and the prisoners are
allowed to sit in the vicinity of the jail.<br>
Every fifteen minutes, starting from the beginning of play, all
prisoners are released from jail. They must return to their home
territories at reasonable speed, by the most direct route. They are
ethereal (may not use, drop, or pick up magic items, are not affected by
magic items, may not capture, and may not be captured) until they
return to their home territory. They must use jazz hands to signal that
they are ethereal.<br>
If you touch a prisoner in the other team's jail, and freeing them does
not break the chain leading back to the Glyph of Jail, they are freed. You
both become ethereal, and must return to your home territory as on a
jailbreak (etherial, with jazz hands).<br>
The jailer (if one exists) also has a supply of Truth Serum. He may
poke a prisoner in the shoulder with a pinky, making the prisoner an
interrogation victim, and freeing any previous victim. The victim is
now under the control of the jailer, and may not use magic items until
freed from interrogation. The jailer may ask the prisoner up to six yes/no
questions, and the victim may lie no more than once. They may answer "I
don't know" if they really don't know, but then the question doesn't
count against the six.<br>
The questioning is finished when the victim answers the sixth question,
if the jailer decides they are done, if the victim is freed, at jailbreak,
if there is no jailer, or if the jailer leaves line of sight of the
victim. At this point, the victim becomes ethereal and must return to
their home territory as after a jailbreak (etherial, with jaz hands).<br>

<h3>Initial Setup and Game Completion</h3>

At the beginning of the game, there is a setup period of fifteen minutes. This
time should be used for the placement of flags and glyphs, and distribution of
magic items. No player may enter enemy territory during this period;
they must remain in their own territories or neutral
space.  Magic items have no effect during this time.<br>

The game ends after one hour, or when there remains only one team with
uncaptured flags.  The winner is the team with the greatest number of points;
in the case of a tie, the winner is the tying team that reached its final point
total first.<br>

<h3>Additional Terms </h3>

<ul>
<li>Cooldown: This is a property of certain items. An item with cooldown may not be
used again for one minute after its use. </li>

<li>Concealment: Potions may be concealed, meaning they need not be visible. All
other game items must be visible at all times. A captive is not required to
give up a concealed item unless their captor asks for it specifically and knows
that she has the item. Potions cannot be used while concealed. </li>

<li>Dispelling: A dispelled item may not be used for its magical effects. Ussually items are dispelled for one minute. </li>

<li> Feild of Veiw: The field of view is the extent of the observable world that is visible to the player at any given moment. </li>

<li>Line of Sight: A player is within line of sight of an item or event if they can
rotate themself to bring it into their field of view.</li>

<li>Sacrificial: Certain items are sacrificial. These items may only be used in
enemy territory, must be dropped upon use, and may not be picked up or moved
when in enemy territory.</li>

<li>See: A player sees an item or glyph if it passes within their field of view and
they can recognize it.</li>

<li>Stun: A stunned player must sit on the floor in the territory in which they were stunned until the stun wears off. If they are
captured while stunned, they become unstunned. A player may not be stunned again
while stunned.  Stunned players may not capture.</li>

<li>Key Words/Phrases: Some potions have a key word or phrase used to activate
them.  This phrase must be said entirely in the territory where the use occurs,
and the action occurs upon completion of the phrase. <b>You cannot use a key 
phrase without the intention of activating an item. </b> </li>


<li>Knowledge: Knowing somebody had a potion is not the same as knowing they have it now. If they could have gotten rid of it, you don't know they have it.
</ul>

<h3>Flags</h3>

As the name implies, the goal is to capture the opposing team's flags.  These
are large pieces of cloth or felt; each team has three or more of them.  Before
each game, a point value will be assigned to each flag.  If you bring an enemy
flag to the judge's room, your team gets the points for the flag.<br>

During the initial setup time, flags must be placed, with placement supervised
by a judge.  They must be placed no more than six feet above the floor, with at
least half the flag visible from every angle.  There may be no more than one
flag per hallway or corridor.  If the flag is placed inside a container, there
must be an obvious way to remove the flag in one smooth motion.<br>

No flag may ever exist in an area with fewer than two exits, unless it is being
carried. If a flag is dropped in an area with only one exit, a judge must move
it the shortest possible distance to a valid location.<br>

Any magic items a player is carrying are dispelled if they are
carrying a flag, and remain dispelled for one minute after the player
gives up the item or drops the flag.<br>

<h3>Judges</h3>
Judges wear blue headbands, and are responsible for keeping the game
running smoothly. The head judge is the final arbiter and scorekeeper,
and should remain in the judges' room, Wean Hall 8427. An assistant
head judge shall reside at each team's jail, and there are ussually at
least 2 roaming judges per team whose job is to resolve conflicts or
perform other duties required of them.<br>
Judges should attempt to resolve disputes fairly and find outcomes
agreeable to both sides. In all cases, the judge's
decision is final.<br>


<h2>Glyphs </h2>
Glyphs are large sheets of paper or posterboard marked with a spell.
Each glyph is colored with a team's color, and belongs to that team; it
only affects members of the opposing team. The Glyphs are distinguished
by a word printed on them.<br>
The glyph must be taped to a wall or door in the team's territory, and
may not be placed within ten feet of a flag. If a flag is dropped
within ten feet of a glyph other than the Glyph of Jail, that glyph is
dispelled for as long as the flag remains, and for one minute after.<br>

<h3>Glyph of Jail ("Jail")</h3>

It functions as described above under "Jail", and may not be dispelled.<br>

<h3>Glyph of Entrancement ("Gotcha")</h3>
If you see an enemy Glyph of Entrancement, you are stunned for one minute.

<h3>Glyph of the Disgusting Doorknob ("Yukko")</h3>
If an enemy Glyph of the Disgusting Doorknob is on the side of a
door facing you, you may not open the door or prevent it from
closing. If the Glyph is mounted on one of a set of doors, all doors
are affected.<br>

If a Glyph of the Disgusting Doorknob is mounted next to the
buttons controlling an elevator, you may not push any of the buttons or
prevent the elevator doors from closing.<br>

Multiple Glyphs of the Disgusting Doorknob may not be used to trap enemy
players in an area; every area must have at least one path to neutral space
which enemy players can travel without running into this Glyph.  Note that this
path is directed; glyphs on the other side of the door do not matter to this
path.
<br>

<h3>Glyph of Alarm ("Alarm")</h3>
If you see the Glyph of Alarm, you must shout or sing "Alarm" or a similar loud
phrase as loudly as possible for one minute or until you are captured or return
to neutral space.<br>


<h2>Potions </h2>

Potions are <font color="red">small pieces of foam wrapped in colored tape</font> which are concealable: you may hide them, and if
captured, you do not need to give them up unless your captor knows you have
them.  They are not useable while concealed. They are distinguished by color.<br>

<h3>Ninja Potion of Magic Smoke (Red, Sacrificial)</h3>
The Ninja Potion of Magic Smoke is sacrificial, so may only be used in
enemy territory and must be dropped on use. Further, it may only be
used by a captured player on the way to jail. He may throw this potion
onto the ground and yell as loudly as possible "Poof, I am a Ninja!" All
enemy players who hear this and are within line of sight of the user
are stunned for 10 seconds. (This does include players in other
territories; if you use this potion near the border between
territories, enemy players in your home territory who are within line
of sight are still stunned. Players in neutral territory, of course,
are immune to stuff, so are unaffected.)<br>

<h3>Potion of Wait... There's a Key at the Bottom of This (Green, Cooldown)</h3>
The Potion of Wait... There's a Key at the Bottom of This has cooldown,
so you must wait a minute before reusing it.
If you are stunned or a prisoner, you may use this potion by bonking
yourself on the head, and using one of the keywords "Lolt", "Jube", or
"Key". You are then free; you are unstunned or free from jail. If freed
from jail, you do <i>not</i> get "free backs": you are merely a normal player standing in the middle of the enemy jail.<br>
(For the curious, this is the combination or the two potions formerly
known as "Jolt" and "Lube", which is where the unusual keywords come
from.)<br>

<h3>Potion of Mind Control (Blue)</h3>
This potion is used by a captor, who gives it to their captive. The captive must accept it and proceed directly to jail as if escorted by the captor. The captive is still a captive, but the captor is no longer a captor. The captor is stunned for 10 seconds and then becomes a normal player again. The captive must display the potion on the way to jail so as not to be confused with free players, and must take the most direct route to jail.<br>

<h2>Wands</h2>
Wands are two-foot lengths of foam rubber, distinguished by color. They
are used by whapping a person or glyph and shouting the appropriate
keyword. Each use of the keyword invokes at most one wand on one
subject.<br>

<h3>Wand of Vengeance (Red, "Toast", Sacrificial)</h3>

This wand is sacrificial, so may only be used in enemy territory and must be
dropped after use.  If you whap an enemy player with this wand in the enemy's home
territory, you capture them and you must lead them back to your jail as on a
normal capture.  However, you are both ethereal until you get into your home
territory, at which point you become a normal captor/captive pair.  Thus, you
may not ask for their items, may not be stunned, etc., until you reach your home
territory.<br>

<h3>Wand of Stun (Green, "Stun", Cooldown)</h3>
Any player whapped with this wand is stunned for one minute.<br>

<h3>Wand of Dispel (Blue, "Dispel", Cooldown)</h3>
If a player is whapped with the wand of dispel, all magic items they are carrying
are dispelled for one minute.  If two
players simultaneously use this wand on each other, all items carried by both
players are dispelled for one minute.<br>

The wand may also be used on a glyph <font color="red">(other than the Glyph of Jail)</font>; it is then dispelled for one minute.<br>

<h2>Belts </h2>
Belts are long sashes of cloth or felt, which must be tied around a
player's waist to be active. A belt can be worn by at most one player,
and a player can wear at most one belt. Belts are distinguished by
color.<br>

<h3>Andy Warhol's Belt of Pop Occultism (Red, Sacrificial)</h3>
Andy Warhol's Belt of Pop Occultism is sacrificial, so may only be used in
enemy territory, and while it must be worn to use it, it must be dropped
immediately after use.  To use this belt, yell as loudly as possible, "Leroy Jenkins" or some phrase
to be determined by the judges before the start of the game.  The effect is to
stun all enemy players within line of sight of the user for one minute.<br>

<h3>Goombah's Belt of Humiliating Protection (Green)</h3>
This belt is activated by skipping and loudly singing "Yankee Doodle". While
active, the wearer is immune to capture and stun.  Any number of teammates may
share the protection of this belt by holding hands with the wearer, either
directly or through a chain of teammates, as long as all teammates in the chain
are skipping and singing along.<br>
If any player in the chain is dispelled, all items carried by all
members of the chain are dispelled; it is as though all players were
hit with the wand. In particular, Goombah's belt is dispelled.<br>

<b>This belt does not function in elevators.</b> <br>

<h3>Doc Ock's Belt of Many Arms (Blue)</h3>
If you are wearing this belt, you may have up to four captives, as long
as you are within an
arm's length of each previous captive when you capture a new one. If
you have at least one captive, you must lead them back to jail as usual;
but may make more captures on the way to jail, as long as you are
within an arm's reach of the previous captives at the time of capture.<br>
If the belt is dispelled when you have multiple captives, all but the
first are freed. If there is a tie for first captive, the captor
chooses which one to keep.<br>


<h2> Sportsmanship </h2>
This is intended to be a friendly and fun game for all involved. This
works much better if all players involved make an honest attempt to
follow the rules. The following are additional rules to help make the
game fun for all.
<h3> Physicality </h3>

<ul>
<li>Do not physically impede or block other players, either with your body or
with objects.  This includes actions like preventing elevators from
moving.  Breakage of this rule is grounds to eject you from the game.</li>
<li>Do not change official timekeeping watches.</li>
<li>Do not fabricate or replicate game items.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Lies </h3>
Although lies and deceit are part of the game, there are several things you may not conceal, obfuscate, or lie about.
<ul>
<li>You may not lie about whether you're in the game.</li>
<li>You may not lie about which team you're on.</li>
<li>You may not lie about the status of the game.  (For example, whether the game has started or ended.)</li>
<li>You may not lie about what non-concealable items you have.</li>
<li>You may not lie about cooldown or dispel status of items.</li>
<li>You may not lie about any player's status.</li>
<li>You may not make jazz hands unless you are ethereal.</li>
<li>You may not display a Potion of Mind Control openly in enemy territory unless you are a captive heading to jail.
</ul>
